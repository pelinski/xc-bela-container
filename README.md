# xc-bela-container

Docker image for [Bela](https://bela.io/) development and cross-compilation. Uses GCC 10, CMake and Make for a fast and modular build. By containerizing the cross-compilation toolchain, Bela code can be written and compiled on any host OS that can run Docker, and is compiled much faster and with more flexibility than in the Bela IDE.

A tutorial using this cross-compiler for recording datasets and running torch models on Bela can be found [here](https://github.com/pelinski/pybela-pytorch-xc-tutorial)

## Basic usage

### Starting the container

**You can pull the xc-bela-container image from the Docker image hub:**

```bash
docker pull pelinski/xc-bela-container:v1.1.0
```

There are images for both `amd64` and `arm64` architectures, the pull command will pull the correct one for your machine. If you are on a different machine you will have to build the image yourself (see below).

You can then start a container with (replace the `BBB_HOSTNAME` with the IP address of your Bela â€“ if you are on Windows, it's `192.168.6.2`):

```bash
docker run -it --name bela-container -e BBB_HOSTNAME=192.168.7.2 pelinski/xc-bela-container:v1.1.0
```

You can quit the container with `Ctrl+D` or `exit`. You can start it again with:

```bash
docker start -ia bela-container
```

### Copying your project to the container

Open another terminal in your laptop and run the following command to copy the `basic` example project to the container:

```bash
docker cp basic bela-container:/sysroot/root/Bela/projects/
```

### Copy the `libbelafull.so` library to Bela

You will need to copy the `libbelafull.so` library from the Docker container into your Bela. You can do so by running, inside the Docker container (you can start it with `docker start -ia bela-container`):

```bash
scp /sysroot/root/Bela/lib/libbelafull.so  root@$BBB_HOSTNAME:Bela/lib/libbelafull.so
```

### Cross-compiling with cmake

To cross-compile the project, we need to tell the compiler that we are cross-compiling for Bela. That information is inside the container, in the `/sysroot/root/Bela/Toolchain.cmake` file.

You can cross-compile a project by running the following commands inside the container:

```shell
cd /sysroot/root/Bela/projects/basic # path to the project
mkdir build && cd build
cmake -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=/sysroot/root/Bela/Toolchain.cmake  -DPROJECT_NAME=basic ../
cmake --build .
```

You can then copy the compiled project to Bela by running:

```bash
rsync --timeout=10 -avzP /sysroot/root/Bela/projects/basic/build/basic root@192.168.7.2:~/Bela/projects/basic/
```

You can now run the project in Bela:

```bash
ssh root@bela.local
cd Bela/projects/basic
./basic
```

### Extra: using make inside the container

This fails for projects that include certain libraries, such as the Gui or the Scope. For other projects, you can use the `make` command to compile the project, as you would use it in Bela.

```bash
cd /sysroot/root/Bela
make PROJECT=basic -j5
```

As before, you can copy the compiled project to Bela and run it with:

```bash
rsync -av /sysroot/root/Bela/projects/basic root@192.168.7.2:Bela/projects/
ssh -t root@192.168.7.2 ./Bela/projects/basic/basic
```

## Building the docker image

Instead of pulling the image from the Docker image hub, you can build the image yourself.

You will need to have [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) installed and running.

Clone this repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/pelinski/xc-bela-container.git
cd xc-bela-container
```

Then, connect the Bela to your laptop. If the Bela IP address is not `192.168.7.2` (e.g., in Windows it's `192.168.6.2`), update it in `scripts/build_settings`.

**Note:** The docker image will update the Bela repo branch in your Bela platform to the commit or branch specified in `scripts/build_settings`. Currently it is set to the `dev` branch.

You can build the docker image using (it will take a while):

```bash
docker build -t xc-bela .
```

_If you get library-related errors, run this `ssh root@192.168.7.2 -t cd Bela && make coreclean && make -f Makefile.libraries all` and try building the docker image again._

Once the image is built is built you can start a container with:

```bash
docker run -it --name bela-container -e BBB_HOSTNAME=192.168.7.2  xc-bela
```

### Advanced: Building docker images for different architectures

When you build the docker image, it will be built for the architecture of your host machine. If you want to build a docker image for a different architecture, you can use the `buildx` command.

First, you need to enable the `buildx` command. You can do so by running (these commands have been tested on a MacbookPro Intel):

```bash
docker buildx create --name xc-builder --use --driver docker-container
docker run --privileged linuxkit/binfmt:v1.0.0
docker buildx inspect --bootstrap
```

(If you get an error saying that the `xc-builder` already exists, you can remove it by running `docker buildx rm xc-builder`.)

Then, you can build the image for a different architecture by running (replace the `linux/arm64` with the architecture you want to build for):

```bash
docker buildx build --platform linux/arm64 --load -t xc-bela .
```
